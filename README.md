This is an exploratory analysis of questions related to R posted on Stack Overflow. This project was created as part of the course Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (EDAV Fall 2018) at Columbia University under Prof. Joyce Robbins.

The data is collected by web scraping Stack Overflow pages using Selecnium in python. The csv files are generated by the python scripts. The subsequent data analysis and visualization is implemented in R. The file **StackOverflow_Analysis.Rmd** contains the R code used for the analysis.
